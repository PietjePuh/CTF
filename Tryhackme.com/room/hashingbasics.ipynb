      "DESCRIPTION\n",
      "     The hashing methods implemented by crypt(3) are designed only to process\n",
      "     user passphrases for storage and authentication; they are not suitable\n",
      "     for use as general-purpose cryptographic hashes.\n",
      "\n",
      "     Passphrase hashing is not a replacement for strong passphrases.  It is\n",
      "     always possible for an attacker with access to the hashed passphrases to\n",
      "     guess and check possible cleartext passphrases.  However, with a strong\n",
      "     hashing method, guessing will be too slow for the attacker to discover a\n",
      "     strong passphrase.\n",
      "\n",
      "     All of the hashing methods use a ‚Äúsalt‚Äù to perturb the hash function, so\n",
      "     that the same passphrase may produce many possible hashes.  Newer methods\n",
      "     accept longer salt strings.  The salt should be chosen at random for each\n",
      "     user.  Salt defeats a number of attacks:\n",
      "\n",
      "     1.   It is not possible to hash a passphrase once and then test it\n",
      "\t  against each account's stored hash; the hash calculation must be re‚Äê\n",
      "\t  peated for each account.\n",
      "\n",
      "     2.   It is not possible to tell whether two accounts use the same\n",
      "\t  passphrase without successfully guessing one of the phrases.\n",
      "\n",
      "     3.   Tables of precalculated hashes of commonly used passphrases must\n",
      "\t  have an entry for each possible salt, which makes them impractically\n",
      "\t  large.\n",
      "\n",
      "     All of the hashing methods are also deliberately engineered to be slow;\n",
      "     they use many iterations of an underlying cryptographic primitive to in‚Äê\n",
      "     crease the cost of each guess.  The newer hashing methods allow the num‚Äê\n",

      "FORMAT OF HASHED PASSPHRASES\n",
      "     All of the hashing methods supported by crypt(3) produce a hashed\n",
      "     passphrase which consists of four components: prefix, options, salt, and\n",
      "     hash.  The prefix controls which hashing method is to be used, and is the\n",
      "     appropriate string to pass to crypt_gensalt(3) to select that method.\n",
      "     The contents of options, salt, and hash are up to the method.  Depending\n",
      "     on the method, the prefix and options components may be empty.\n",
      "\n",
      "     The setting argument to crypt(3) must begin with the first three compo‚Äê\n",
      "     nents of a valid hashed passphrase, but anything after that is ignored.\n",
      "     This makes authentication simple: hash the input passphrase using the\n",
      "     stored passphrase as the setting, and then compare the result to the\n",
      "     stored passphrase.\n",
      "\n",

      "     guess and check possible cleartext passphrases.  However, with a strong\n",
